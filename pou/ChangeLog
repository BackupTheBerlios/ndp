	* PoUgui/src/mc/: Temporary mc wrapper

2004-03-22  Thomas <thomas@pumpkins.snapshotlinux.org>
	* tests/constructrbf.cc: use BIHARMONIC instead of TRI (because 
	TRI does not work)
	use point reduction from ImplicitSurface
	save computed file in test.pou

	* src/ConstructRBF.cc: use 0 instead of NULL in constructor
	(cf Stroustrup)

	* src/ImplicitSurface3D.cc: filter set to null because
	constraints are filled the way (rgb,0) would have done.


2004-03-22  Ben  <leserpent@berlios.de>

	* libpou/src/ImplicitSurface3D.cc: setFilter can't be called again
	after a compute(BUG?).

	* libpou/tests/implicitsurface3d.cc (main): The number of
	points used for the test has been limited.

	* libpou/src/ConstructRBF.cc: c is allocated and deleted by
	derivated class.

2004-03-22  Ben  <leserpent@berlios.de>

	* libpou/src/ConstructRBF.h (setSize): Removed comments around w's
	and center's deletes
	(setSize): Removed if(w), delete NULL is ok.
